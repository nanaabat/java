In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, an M/M/1 queue represents the queue length in a system
having a single server, where arrivals are determined by a Poisson process and job service times have an exponential distribution.

The model name is written in Kendal's notation. The model is the most elementary of queueing models and an attractive object of study as closed-fpr,
expressions can be obtained for many metrics of interest in this model. An extension of this model with more than one server is the M/M/2 queue

This queue is a stochastic process whose state space is set the {0,1,2,3...}, where the value corresponds to the number of customers
in the service.

- Arrivals occur at rate according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i +1
- Service times have an exponential distribution with rate parameter u in the M/M/1 queue, where 1/u is the mean service

//to be honest I have no idea what this is saying now, but I am hoping to understand this sometime in the future
